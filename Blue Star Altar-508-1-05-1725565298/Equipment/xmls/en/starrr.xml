<text id="STARdesc">Behold the starry river, gently calling to the wanderer. You and I are dust among the stars, yet to find a place to return to. Why can't we touch each other? Why must we be apart? The night is silent, and the stars mourn.</text>
<text id="STARweaponstory">Teardrops slide down, thoughts unable to dispel. My heart echoes, the stars hang high. Though we can't see one another, the light of the stars shine down on me. I'm not afraid of the road ahead. We'll meet again, once all is said and done.</text>
