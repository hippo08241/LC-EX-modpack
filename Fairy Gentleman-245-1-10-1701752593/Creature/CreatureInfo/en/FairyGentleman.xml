Although it's friendlier than most of the guys here, standing there, saying hello with stinky bubbles and inviting you sit down. When he handed me a cup of... thing? thing like rotten green tea jelly on which a few eyeballs, maybe, was floating... , I hesitated. （Why so detailed I describe it? because this fxxking cr*p had entered my throat!）
No, it's not trick. It's is my work. As for how I drank it... I thought this moldy green matcha cake can free me out from here just like the purple soda in that soda machine and make me happy.But, my meaning, but really nothing happen... only my wounds were healed. And, this thing tastes good... holy cr*p I must check my tongue...}
