<text id="Tianhuo_weapon_desc1">The form that appears when the Key of Destruction, "Judgement of Shamash", has fully liberated its power. The twin spears stretch out to form the hilts of the swords.
A hot flame like molten gold rises up to the sky and coalesces into the sword's body. As its name suggests, it brings absolute destruction to all things.</text>
<text id="Tianhuo_weapon_specialDesc1">There is a 20% chance a special attack will be triggered to inflict 40 points of RED damage.
When the wielder of this weapon has 100% HP, their next attack will drain 50% of their HP and add it as damage to the next special attack made.</text>

<text id="Tianhuo_weapon_name2">Soul Annihilation</text>
<text id="Tianhuo_weapon_desc2">As each of the thousands stars carved their own flames, one displayed their supreme power over all.
The flames consumed the heavens, and not even dust remains of the souls felled by this blade. This is the Sword of the End.</text>
<text id="Tianhuo_weapon_specialDesc2">On occasion, attacks will create a dash that deals 10 points of RED damage.
This attack drains 10 HP from the wielder when their HP is above 50%, and will increase the damage to 80 points of RED damage. When the wielder's HP is below 50%, the damage is reduced to 40.</text>

However, its true power seems to have been sealed away.</text>
<text id="Tianhuo_weapon_specialDesc3">Attacks have a 20% chance of generating a blast of fire, dealing 5 points of RED damage.</text>
