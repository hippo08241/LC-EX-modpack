This mod work by making the abno id(the one you use for standard fifo) or creatureId in the game code that are out of codex range to be in range.
The new id start from 1 and will be increment by 1
For example if abno id is 500000 it will be change into 1 and the next out of range will be 1 + 1 or 2 and 3 and so on
This is just the id use by the codex so it shouldn't mess with anything in the game and no mod abno have and id in a 1-1000 or 1-10000 the nearest one is around 18xxx or in negative number which should make this id change to be safe until we got more than 10000 abno id that out of range or the new creator set abno id to be very low(less than 100)

I test this and it work with or without codex fix and sort mod, Abnormality Seal mod, and it also work with standard fifo command for the original id of the abno(not the new id that i replace)

****************
Some abno still don't want to show up in codex. This happen because their observation level isn't max (IsMaxObserved() = false)
I still don't know how to fix this but if you find more abno that doesn't show up you can report them in the bug section or in PM community discord lobotomy mod section or LMM discord.
