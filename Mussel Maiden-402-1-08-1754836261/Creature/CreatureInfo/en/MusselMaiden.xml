The converse is also true: different combinations of genotypes can have nearly identical phenotypes under certain conditions. What would happen if you modified those genotypes and phenotypes? Altered them? You could make a theoretically ‘perfect’ being. This is a soul that has benefited from such genetic modifications, a one-in-ten-thousand rare individual. Beautiful, isn't it?"}
