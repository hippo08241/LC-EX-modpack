<text id="NailAndHammer_weapon_desc">A nail can fasten many things.
For instance, a heart. For instance, a life. For instance, a crime.
Wield the nail and the hammer and pronounce judgment upon others.
There is no justice in it, only judgment and punishment.

<text id="NailAndHammer_armor_desc">Before chains are fastened to man’s body, before burdens are tied to his back, crime has already done so in his heart.

By the time you come to your senses, you are already a nail, fixed firmly in place.
Crime. Perhaps that is all it truly is.</text>
