Your audio files must be converted to proper .wav format first. If you don't already, use programs like Audacity.

Name your .wav music files based on the emergency level you want them to play for:
- Neutral: NORMAL.wav
- First Warning: LEVEL1.wav
- Second Warning: LEVEL2.wav
- Third Warning: LEVEL3.wav
- Fourth Warning: LEVEL4.wav
If the game didn't found any custom music for the emergency level, it will use the default one.

If you had issues, make sure the music you want to play is a proper .wav file (like, not just renaming from mp3 to wav)
and a correct name based on the format I've given above.
