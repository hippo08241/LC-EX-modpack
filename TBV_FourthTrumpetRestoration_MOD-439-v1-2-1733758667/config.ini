; Configuration File for the Fourth Trumpet Restoration Mod

; The values are automatically readjusted to prevent (human) errors, if needed.
; For example, if third is 100, and fourth is 50, it will automatically readjust
; to 125 for the fourth, and 150 for the maximum threshold (if the max was 100).
; The above also applies to threshold values with identical values.
