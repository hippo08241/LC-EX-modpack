    <specialTip openLevel="1" key="1">When work was committed by employee Onorino who had less than 2 Fortitude, the work success rate was hugely increased. If said work results in Good, $0 gave the employee its E.G.O Gift.</specialTip>
    <specialTip openLevel="2" key="2">When work was committed by an employee with more than 3 Fortitude, the work success rate decreased. If said employee attempted Attachment work, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</specialTip>
    <specialTip openLevel="3" key="3">When the work result was Bad, the Qliphoth Counter lowered.</specialTip>
    <specialTip openLevel="4" key="4">When $0's Qliphoth Counter reached 0, employee Onorino - who had recieved its E.G.O. gift - turned into a "knight". Those turned into a knight can be normalized via restoring their SP with WHITE or BLACK damage, similar to a panicking employee. When the "knight" is either suppressed or killed, White Lake's Qliphoth Counter returned to max. If no employee has White Lake's E.G.O. Gift, the employee who entered the Containment Cell became a "knight".</specialTip>
